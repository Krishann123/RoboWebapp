Before building and programming start, the simulation system determines the placement of random mission props. The main frame of the task props refers to the schematic diagram of the task description. The actual construction of the props may be different. For example, the actual beams, pins and other structural colors are different, or the size and height are slightly different. Contestants should have the ability to adjust according to the actual situation. Once the location is determined, try to be the same for each game. Contestants can choose the tasks to be completed by themselves. Throughout the competition, the robot needs to drive along the flight path and complete various tasks set in the field according to the requirements of the \"task process\". Every time a task is completed, the corresponding task score can be obtained (See Appendix 1 for specific scores). The task area of the basic task is set according to the task rules and corresponds to the task area in the field, and all groups need to complete it. Random missions set up some obstacles or props around the flight path, and each group sets up random missions of varying numbers (see 5.4 randomness), players can choose the tasks to be completed by themselves.
