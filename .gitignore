# IMPORTANT: ONLY IGNORE international/dist if you are NOT intentionally committing it.
# If you ARE intentionally committing international/dist, then DO NOT add /international/dist/ here.
# Given your last comment, you *are* committing it, so let's allow it for now.

# However, these look like temporary build artifacts inside ROBOLUTION/public/international
# These should almost certainly be ignored:
/ROBOLUTION/public/international/
# This ^ will ignore everything inside ROBOLUTION/public/international
# unless ROBOLUTION/public/international IS your main server's static content root.
# If ROBOLUTION/public/international is meant to contain ONLY the copied Astro files,
# then ignoring it like this might be tricky.

# Let's be more precise with temporary build artifacts:
# General server entry/manifest files that get rebuilt
ROBOLUTION/public/international/server/entry.mjs
ROBOLUTION/public/international/server/manifest_*.mjs
international/dist/server/entry.mjs
international/dist/server/manifest_*.mjs

# Specific untracked folders you mentioned
ROBOLUTION/public/international/client/images/gallery/ # If these are generated, ignore
international/dist/client/images/gallery/ # If these are generated, ignore

# These look like dependency-related internal folders, should be ignored
